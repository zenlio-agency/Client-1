# ManyaIT website

The ManyaIT marketing site, built with [Astro](https://astro.build) on the
[Lumos for Astro](https://lumosframework.com) framework, in the ManyaIT
palette. ManyaIT is positioned as a GCC (Global Capability Center) technology
and talent partner: "Technology & Talent Partners".

## Run it

Node 22.12 or newer.

```sh
cd site
npm install
npm run dev        # http://localhost:4321
```

| Script            | What it does                                                 |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `npm run dev`     | Dev server with hot reload                                   |
| `npm run build`   | Static build to `dist/`, then checks nothing links to Sanity |
| `npm run preview` | Serves the built site                                        |
| `npm run check`   | Type-checks every `.astro` file                              |
| `npm run format`  | Formats with Prettier                                        |
| `npm run map`     | Regenerates the dot map in `src/data/world-dots.json`        |

`dist/` is plain static files and can go on any host. `wrangler.jsonc` is
already set up for Cloudflare: `npm run build && npx wrangler deploy` publishes
it as an assets-only Worker.

## How it was scaffolded

`npm create lumos@latest` downloads the Lumos for Astro template, which is
itself an Astro project (Astro 7, TypeScript, sitemap, the Astro fonts API).
So it covers what `npm create astro@latest` would set up, and running both
would only produce two separate projects. This site came from create-lumos
0.3.5, Lumos 0.0.4, stamped under `"lumos"` in `package.json` so
`/lumos-upgrade-version` can merge later framework releases.

Lumos conventions (layers, themes, `_wrap` components, `rem` only) are in
`LUMOS.md`.

### Inner pages

Every page the nav and footer link to has its own route. They share a set of
section components, so a new page is mostly copy.

| Page                        | Sections                                                                                                                                                              |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/capabilities`             | `HeroDetail`, `FeatureGrid` (rows), `ProcessSteps`, `TrustStrip`, `FaqList`, `CtaFinal`                                                                               |
| `/capabilities/[slug]` (×5) | `HeroDetail`, `ProblemRows`, `FeatureGrid` + `TrustStrip` (outcomes), `ChipGroups`, `FeatureGrid` (industries), `ProcessSteps`, `FaqList`, `RelatedTiles`, `CtaFinal` |
| `/industries/[slug]` (×4)   | `HeroDetail`, `ProblemRows`, `FeatureGrid` + `TrustStrip` (outcomes), `FeatureGrid` (rows of capabilities), `ChipGroups`, `FaqList`, `RelatedTiles`, `CtaFinal`       |

| `/careers`                  | `CareersOpenings`, `StorySplit`, `FeatureGrid` (benefits, tracks), `ProcessSteps`, `FaqList`, `GlobalPresence`, `CtaFinal`                                            |
| `/locations`                | `HeroDetail`, `HubCards`, `GlobalPresence`, `ProcessSteps`, `FaqList`, `CtaFinal`                                                                                     |
| `/insights`                 | `HeroDetail`, `InsightsGrid`, `FeatureGrid` (topics), `CtaFinal`                                                                                                      |
| `/insights/[slug]` (×5)     | `ArticleHeader`, `ArticleBody` (with `ArticleText`), `RelatedTiles`                                                                                                   |
| `/legal`                    | `LegalHub`, `LegalStrip`                                                                                                                                              |
| `/legal/[slug]` (×6)        | `LegalDocument` (with `LegalHeader`, `LegalToc`, `LegalBody`), `LegalStrip`                                                                                           |
| `/legal/privacy-requests`   | `LegalHeader`, `PrivacyRequestForm`                                                                                                                                   |

Capability and industry names, lines, photos and page copy are edited in
Sanity, so the nav, the bento, the industry cards and pages, the footer and
the contact form's topic list all stay in step. Which capabilities and
industries exist, and their order, is fixed in `src/data/site.ts`;
`capabilityHref` and `industryHref` build the page links, and `TEAM_STEPS`
holds the delivery lifecycle shown on the About page.

## Legal pages

The legal pack lives under `/legal`: a hub, six policies and a privacy
request form. The footer links to each one, and the addresses people guess
(`/privacy`, `/privacy-policy`, `/terms`, `/terms-of-use`, `/cookie-policy`,
`/accessibility`) redirect to them. The redirects are in `astro.config.mjs`,
which writes a forwarding page at each address, and in `public/_redirects`,
which Cloudflare serves as permanent (301) redirects. Keep the two lists the
same.

| Page                      | File                                              |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Privacy Notice            | `src/content/legal/privacy.md`                    |
| Terms of Use              | `src/content/legal/terms.md`                      |
| Cookie Notice             | `src/content/legal/cookies.md`                    |
| Accessibility Statement   | `src/content/legal/accessibility.md`              |
| Applicant Privacy Notice  | `src/content/legal/applicant-privacy.md`          |
| Job Offer Fraud Notice    | `src/content/legal/job-offer-fraud.md`            |
| Privacy requests (a form) | `src/components/content/PrivacyRequestForm.astro` |

Each Markdown file's front matter sets the title, the hub summary, the
"At a glance" bullets, the dates, the version, which contact card closes the
page and the change log (schema in `src/content.config.ts`). Each `##`
heading becomes a numbered section in the "On this page" list, with a stable
link such as `/legal/privacy#your-rights`. Forms and emails point at these
links, so rename a heading only with care.

Facts that appear on more than one page (company names, addresses, emails,
the Grievance Officer, response times) live once in `LEGAL` in
`src/data/legal.ts`. In the Markdown they are written as `{{key}}` tokens,
listed in `LEGAL_TOKENS`, and an unknown token fails the build.

To update a policy: edit the text, set `updated` (as `YYYY-MM-DD`), bump
`version`, and add a line at the top of `changes`. Legal pages have no scroll
reveals, and they print without the nav, footer or contents list.

## Insights articles

Articles are written in the Studio (Insights), served at
`/insights/<address>`, and the Insights grid on the homepage and on
`/insights` lists them in their set order, with a filter per category. Each
has a title, a one-line summary, a category, a type, a photo, a publish
date, the "In short" points, the body (headings, lists, tables and
callouts) and the capability the closing call to action links to. The read
time is worked out from the text. Articles follow the copy rules below: no
client names, statistics or partner claims until they're confirmed.

## Content from Sanity

HR and marketing edit content in the Sanity Studio (`../studio`). The site
reads it at build time from project `n3hghywr`, dataset `production`.
Visitors never load anything from Sanity: photos are copied into the build,
and SVG logos are checked and served from `/media/`.

**What comes from Sanity:** site settings (contacts, button labels, social
profiles, footer line, default description and social image), the homepage,
the header, questions and search text of About, Careers, Contact and the
Capabilities, Industries and Insights pages, the five capabilities, the five
industries, the two offices, the Insights articles and categories, the job
openings, the client logos and the ecosystem company. **What stays in code:**
the design and layout, the fixed sets and their order, and the sections the
Studio has no fields for, such as About's story and commitments, the
operating models, the career tracks and the legal pages.

**Publishing:** a Sanity webhook calls the host's deploy hook whenever
something is published, so the site rebuilds and the change is live in
about two minutes. Setting it up is described in `../studio/README.md`
("Publishing updates the site").

- `src/sanity/content.ts` reads each collection once per build and shapes it
  for the components. Something the design can't do without, such as one of
  the five capabilities, stops the build if it's missing, so the live site
  stays as it was.
- `src/sanity/queries.ts` holds every query. After changing a query or a
  Studio schema, run `npm run typegen` in `studio/` to regenerate
  `src/sanity/types.ts`.
- `src/content.config.ts` has one collection per content type:
  `siteSettings`, `homePage`, `pageSettings`, `capabilities`, `industries`,
  `locations`, `articles`, `articleCategories`, `opportunities`,
  `caseStudies`, `clientLogos` and `ecosystem`. Each is fetched again on
  every build, so unpublished content leaves the site on the next build. If
  Sanity can't be reached, the build fails and the live site stays as it
  was.
- Images: `<SanityImg>` gives a responsive image and `sanityPhoto()` a
  single file for components that take a plain path. Both copy the image
  into the build with the editor's crop and hotspot. `svgFile()` copies an
  SVG as it is, and stops the build if the file could run a script or load
  anything else.
- Rich text: `portableTextToHtml()` gives the same HTML Astro makes from
  Markdown, so `ArticleText` and `RichText` take it unchanged;
  `inlineHtml()` gives the shorter form `FaqList` answers use.
- `studio/seed/production.ndjson` (with its photos in `studio/seed/files/`)
  is the content as it was when the pages moved to Sanity. It's only used
  to fill an empty dataset or to restore that starting point; see
  `../studio/README.md`.
- `npm run build` ends with `scripts/check-dist.mjs`, which fails the build
  if any page links to Sanity or contains the read token.
- Every build also runs the content check
  (`src/integrations/content-check.ts`), described under "Before launch".

| `SANITY_DATASET`    | `production` |                                                                                                  |
| `SANITY_READ_TOKEN` | none         | Only if the dataset is private. Set it on the host, or in `site/.env` locally; never commit it.  |
| `STRICT_CONTENT`    | none         | `1` on the live site's builds only: the content check then stops the build on anything it finds. |

## Brand

The palette comes from the ManyaIT logo directions: Ink Black `#0D0F0D`, Manya
Blue `#2340E6` with its 50–900 ramp, slate text greys, and the success, warning
and error pairs. They are tokens in `src/styles/base.css`, and the four themes
(`light`, `tint`, `dark`, `brand`) map them onto backgrounds, text, borders and
buttons. Every heading uses Plus Jakarta Sans (the `--display-family` token,
with its own leading-trim values), UI text such as buttons, labels and the nav
uses Poppins 400/500/600, and body text uses Inter. All three are self-hosted,
so there are no requests to Google Fonts.

## Motion

- Sections fade and rise into view as they scroll in, in a short stagger.
- Pages cross-fade with native view transitions, and the nav stays still.
- The hero reel scrolls five captioned photos and lifts one at a time. It
  sits at the fold, so it fades in on load rather than on scroll, and the
  hero copy is sized so the top quarter of its cards always shows above the
  fold. The photos and captions are edited in the Studio (Homepage → Photo
  reel).
- The reel and the two client-logo rows scroll as marquees. They pause on
  hover, a tap or click stops or restarts them, and each has a pause button
  that shows only when the keyboard reaches it.
- The data tile in the capabilities grid shows data flowing into a lakehouse
  and out to BI and AI.
- The map draws the Dallas to Hyderabad arc, with a dot travelling along it.
- The mega menu opens with a short transition.

With `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`, nothing moves: reveals are off and the
marquees start paused. Without JavaScript, all content still shows.

## Before launch

Anything in square brackets is a placeholder. Each one goes through `tbc()` in
`src/data/site.ts`, so on the page it shows with a dotted underline and a
"confirm before launch" tooltip.

**The content check** (`src/integrations/content-check.ts`) runs at the end of
every `npm run build` and lists:

- **claims** in Sanity that aren't confirmed yet: figures, client logos, the
  ecosystem company, case-study quotes and client names. It's the same list
  as the Studio's "Proof & claims → Not confirmed yet";
- **placeholders** left on any page, legal pages included;
- **copy rules** broken on any page except the legal notices: banned words,
  and Dallas, Texas or Hyderabad outside the footer (see "Copy rules");
- **office addresses** in Sanity that differ from the ones the legal notices
  give.

Review builds print these as warnings and carry on. Set `STRICT_CONTENT=1`
on the live site's builds (Vercel → Settings → Environment Variables,
Production only), and any of them stops the build, so the version already
live stays up. In that mode the build also stops while Sanity has no
content, since nothing then records whether the site's claims are confirmed.
Two published items of one type with the same page address stop every
build.

The open items:

- **Figures.** The six homepage figures (Homepage → Figures in the Studio)
  stay unconfirmed until someone records who confirmed each one, when, and
  the evidence. An industry's headline figure shows on the Industries page
  once one is entered.
- **Hero photos.** The five reel photos were supplied for the redesign;
  confirm the licence covers use on the live site. The other photos are free
  Unsplash photos saved as WebP. Replace them with ManyaIT's own photography
  when it's ready: in the Studio for capabilities, industries, articles,
  page headers and the reel, and in `public/images/` for the rest.
- **Inner-page facts.** On the About page, the founding year and early
  milestones. On the careers page, health and wellbeing benefits, the length
  of the joining process and the careers email. The platforms, tools and
  standards listed on each capability and industry page describe skills, not
  partnerships; check each list reflects the teams ManyaIT can field. The
  healthcare FAQ says business associate agreements are put in place where
  needed; confirm that holds.
- **Office details.** The phones and emails of both offices, and the
  company email, careers email and phone beside the contact form, are in the
  Studio (Locations, and Site settings). An empty phone or email shows as a
  placeholder.
- **Client logos.** Two marquee rows, set in the Studio (Proof & claims →
  Client logos): banking and finance first, then telecom, healthcare and
  energy. The logos are the companies' official logos from Wikimedia
  Commons. Logos are trademarks, so get written permission from each company
  before launch, record it in the Studio, and remove any that can't be
  cleared. Logos show in grey and turn to full colour on hover.
- **Ecosystem.** The homepage band shows one company, Siri Data Analytics,
  with the logo from its website (Proof & claims → Ecosystem). Confirm the
  listing, its one-line description and the logo in writing before launch.
- **Forms.** The contact form (on `/contact` and at the foot of the homepage,
  both from `ContactConversation`) and the role finder are not connected to
  anything, and each one says so when used. Give the contact `Form` an
  `action` endpoint, which covers both pages. The job openings are the ten
  sample roles, now in the Studio (Careers): replace them with real roles,
  each with its reference code and posting date. The privacy request form on
  `/legal/privacy-requests` needs an endpoint too.
- **Legal pages.** The six policies are drafts written from the legal pack
  design. Counsel in the US and India must write or approve the final
  wording before launch. The open facts are in `LEGAL` in
  `src/data/legal.ts` (entity names, CIN, emails, the Grievance Officer) and
  in brackets in each Markdown file (dates, versions, retention periods,
  governing law, which tools receive form data, and Cloudflare's cookies).
  Before release, load the site in a fresh browser and confirm no cookie or
  third-party request appears that the Cookie Notice doesn't mention.
- **Insights.** The five articles are drafts, all credited to "The ManyaIT
  team". An article without a publish date shows `[Publish date]`. The SAP
  article cites SAP's public maintenance dates (end of 2027, extended to end
  of 2030); confirm before launch.
- **Links.** In Site settings, Instagram links to the account on
  manyait.com; LinkedIn, X, Facebook and YouTube have no address yet, so
  their icons show without a link. The footer, the menu and the contact
  section all read the same list.
- **Domain.** `SITE_URL` in `src/consts.ts` is `https://manyait.com`.
  Sitemap and canonical URLs use it.

## Copy rules

These apply to every word on the site:

- ManyaIT is a technology and talent partner. Tagline: "Technology & Talent
  Partners".
- **Write for B2B decision-makers (important).** The readers are enterprises
  weighing a partnership and talent partners looking at open roles. Use
  high-level business and technical terms: operating model, delivery
  governance, time to value, data estate, production-grade, platform
  engineering, elastic capacity. Leave out basic explanations and everyday
  phrasing ("we listen first", "you meet everyone").
- Imply, never state, that ManyaIT provides vetted tech talent and builds
  teams. Use: talent, specialists, teams, AI-ready, vetted, matched to your
  stack, productive from week one, teams live in weeks, flexible scale, scale
  on demand.
- Never use: recruiting/recruitment, staffing, staff augmentation,
  hire/hiring, placement, headhunting, outsourcing, consulting/consultants,
  agency, contractor, engagement/engagement lead, bench, resources, manpower,
  vendor, GCC, capability center, Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT), headcount,
  skills brief.
- The homepage keeps its original wording at ManyaIT's request, including
  "Global Capability Center" and "build-operate-transfer". Those phrases are
  listed as exceptions in `src/data/copy-rules.ts`, for the homepage only.
- The hero does not lead with the service list or with locations.
- One idea per card, one line per tile.
- The United States is home to the Client & Leadership Hub and India to the
  Engineering & Talent Hub. In section copy and on the map, name the
  countries, once each. City names belong in the footer and in postal
  addresses.
- No client, number, certification or affiliate goes live until it is
  confirmed.

On legal pages, use "service providers" for vendors and contractors,
"sub-processors" for subcontractors of data, "professional advisers" for
consultants, "applicants" and "applications" for candidates and recruiting,
and "project" or "relationship" for engagement. Terms the law defines, such
as "sale", "share", "controller" and "Data Fiduciary", stay as written.

Every build checks the pages against these rules (see "Before launch"). The
list lives in `src/data/copy-rules.ts`, and the Studio warns editors with its
own copy in `studio/lib/validation.ts`; change the two together, and the
build warns when they differ.
